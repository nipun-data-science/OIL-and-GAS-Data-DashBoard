This project involves creating an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze and visualize the sales data from the Oil and Gas industry. The goal of the dashboard is to provide insights into key performance indicators (KPIs) such as sales volume, revenue, market trends, and regional performance. The dashboard is designed to help stakeholders make data-driven decisions by presenting the data in an easy-to-understand and visually appealing format.
